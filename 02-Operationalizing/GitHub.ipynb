    "How might you solve this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Maybe you are using sequentially numbered directories\n",
    "2. Maybe you are using track-changes\n",
    "3. Maybe you are using Google Docs\n",

    "## What is the problem with each of these systems?\n",

    "> What if you overwrite something in the wrong directory?\n",
    "> What if you need to keep track of many files that depend on each other?\n",
    "> What if you want people to propose changes, but not make them?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enter version control\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control lets you offload the work of keeping track of everything related to a project, including *documents*, *visualizations*, and *data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You `initialize` it in a `directory`, and then tell it when you want your changes to be permanent.\n",

    "You can go back to a previous iteration at any time, and can see exactly what has changed between versions.\n",

    "## For this course, we'll be using `git`\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a *distributed* version control system\n",
    "\n",
    "> `--distributed-is-the-new-local`\n",
    "\n",
    "That means it can track, diff, and merge differences between the versions of a file on your system, and on *any other system on this entire planet of Earth*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it an enormously powerful tool for ***collaborative*** work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## For this course, we'll also be using GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "[GitHub](https://github.com) is a website that hosts all of your Git repositories. It's good for keeping tabs on all the modified versions of your file everywhere it appears. While other social coding collaboratory sites exist ([BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), etc.), GitHub is currently the most popular, and has the added advantage for students of [free private repositories](https://education.github.com).\n",
