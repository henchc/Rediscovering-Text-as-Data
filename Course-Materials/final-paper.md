# Rediscovering Text as Data: Final Paper (12/11)

The final paper is due **December 11** by midnight. Please submit your paper via bCourses in "Assignments". Your paper is an essay explaining your project, its conclusions, and its implications. You will also reflect critically on your methods and results. Essays come in various forms, and you are encouraged to write about the parts of your project you found most interesting. Nevertheless, we suggest you incorporate into, or structure your paper around the following components:

**Situate your work**: What is your project about? Who will care? Why now?

**Literature review**: Have researchers written about the phenomenon you're investigating? About the corpus? What did they find? Why does your project matter in this discussion? ***Please cite at least 1 article here to help motivate your essay***. Citation format can be MLA, APA, or Chicago. Please be consistent.

**Research question**: What is, ultimately, your research question? What do you want to know? What would the existing literature make us think? Why are you undertaking this project? Why does it matter? How can it contribute new knowledge?

**Data collection/justification**: How did you collect your data? Why or how can it best answer your research question (over other datasets)? What problems or biases might your data have? Can these be rectified? How is your dataset bounded? What is the time period? What are the limitations of the dataset?

**Methodological explanation/justification**: What method did you use? Why do you think this was the best method to answer your question? How have other researchers used this method? Are there potential problems with using this method? How does it work conceptually? Can it be reproduced? What steps have you taken to ensure reproducibility?

**Results/Discussion**: What did you find? How does it compare to similar studies? What assumptions were made in yielding these results? Do your results conform to your expectations?

**Problems & Improvements**: Were there any problems you could not address? Should the reader be aware of any shortcuts you took? How might one improve upon your work?

**Critical reflection**: What decisions did you make that may not be methodologically wrong, but have strong consequences on your results? How might your results be interpreted? How should (or can) they be interpreted? What humanist implications does your study have? How does it tell us more about society?

All code (Jupyter Notebooks) must be published on GitHub as we have discussed in class. Please include a link in your paper. If your data have already been published, or you used an existing dataset, please simply add a link and detailed explanation of the dataset in your notebook's markdown. If you collected your own data, it is not under copyright, and the source of your data has approved your publishing of them, please include this in the GitHub repository too. Otherwise, please provide one example of your corpus and a detailed expanation of the dataset if it is inaccessible for any reasons. Please also state the reason it is inaccessible.

If you are working in a group, it is expected that each member will submit their own paper with their own interpretations and explanations. The code will be the same.
